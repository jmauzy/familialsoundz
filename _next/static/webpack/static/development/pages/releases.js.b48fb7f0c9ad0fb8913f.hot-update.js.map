I imagine it sounds like what would have happened if\n\t\tRichard D James was spending more time naked in Icelandic hot springs and\n\t\tless time dropping acid in British clubs. The album then hums through\n\t\tSmell Memory and into the wonderfully textured There Is a Number of\n\t\tSmall Things, building to a beautiful vocal crescendo. The B-side is my\n\t\tpersonal favorite. Never have two songs been more appropriately titled than\n\t\tAsleep on a Train and Awake on a Train. The back half of the album finds\n\t\ta wonderful groove with my highlights being Random Summer and The Ballad\n\t\tof the Broken String.`}\n\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t{oneLine`It’s very easy to draw comparisons to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Kid A era\n\t\tRadiohead and the like, all of whom were working in melodic soundscapes around\n\t\tthe time this album came out. There’s a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy, however,\n\t\tthat makes Yesterday Was Dramatic much more than an IDM also-ran of the era.\n\t\tRemember when twee wasn’t a pejorative?\n\t\t`}\n\t\t</>\n\t},\n\n\t2: {\n\t\tdate: '2019-07-01',\n\t\tissue: 2,\n\t\ttitle: 'Criola',\n\t\tartist: 'Denis Mpunga & Paul K.',\n\t\tyear: '2017',\n\t\tdiscogs_release: 9918038,\n\t\tcolor: '#ffd672',\n\t\tdescription: <>{oneLine`\n\t\t\tCRIOLA is a compilation of early '80s recordings by Belgian/Congolese duo Denis\n\t\t\tMpunga & Paul K. It's an incredibly funky sound that combines smooth African\n\t\t\tcrooning with experimental synths and drum machines. The juxtaposition is\n\t\t\tintoxicating, it feels like cruising in a Delorean through the jungle at night.`}\n\t\t\t<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t{oneLine`The title track, CRIOLA, is a certified banger with a percussion line that\n\t\t\tsinks its teeth into your spinal cord and stays with you.

Of all the albums I have\n\t\tlistened to over the past 3 years, I have probably played this one the most--it's\n\t\tat least in the top 5. It's incredible. I first discovered this album on\n\t\tYouTube, presumably because I had been listening to another album from the\n\t\tCBS/Sony Sound Image series (read more about it in the link below), Haruomi\n\t\tHosono's Pacific (also incredible--not hyperbole). It's not necessarily a\n\t\tJune album, but it's definitely a warm weather album. I've chosen this album\n\t\tfor my first issue primarily out of necessity. Light in the Attic Records\n\t\treissued 1,000 copies of this album a couple months ago (I ordered it in\n\t\tJanuary) for $45 a pop--original pressings go for $300+ on Discogs--and I\n\t\tknew I wanted to share it with both of you, so I bought myself 3 copies,\n\t\tand here we are now. As far as highlights are concerned, I'd say it's just\n\t\ta really great album with great flow and sequencing, and culminates/concludes\n\t\twith a real stunner and tearjerker masterpiece in \"Blue Memories\". It's way\n\t\tmore nuanced and emotional than most exotica/tropicalia records, and I think\n\t\tthat's what gives it so much charm. `}\n\t\t</>\n\t},\n};\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAYA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAxBA;AAkCA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA1BA;AA8BA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AARA;AAjEA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
