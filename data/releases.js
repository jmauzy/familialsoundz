		Though not as as well-known (or perhaps accessible) as their followup Finally We Are
		No One, múm’s debut Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today is OK, was a critical darling
		and one of the more inspired electronic releases of the late 90s.`}
		<br/><br/>
		{oneLine`The album introduces itself well with I’m 9 Today, which dives straight into
		clicky, IDM-esque arrangements of acoustic samples and backing melodies of more
		traditional instruments. I imagine it sounds like what would have happened if
		Richard D James was spending more time naked in Icelandic hot springs and
		less time dropping acid in British clubs. The album then hums through
		Smell Memory and into the wonderfully textured There Is a Number of
		Small Things, building to a beautiful vocal crescendo. The B-side is my
		personal favorite. Never have two songs been more appropriately titled than
		Asleep on a Train and Awake on a Train. The back half of the album finds
		a wonderful groove with my highlights being Random Summer and The Ballad
		of the Broken String.`}
		<br/><br/>
		{oneLine`It’s very easy to draw comparisons to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Kid A era
		Radiohead and the like, all of whom were working in melodic soundscapes around
		the time this album came out. There’s a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy, however,
		that makes Yesterday Was Dramatic much more than an IDM also-ran of the era.
		Remember when twee wasn’t a pejorative?

			CRIOLA is a compilation of early '80s recordings by Belgian/Congolese duo Denis
			Mpunga & Paul K. It's an incredibly funky sound that combines smooth African
			crooning with experimental synths and drum machines. The juxtaposition is
			intoxicating, it feels like cruising in a Delorean through the jungle at night.`}
			<br/><br/>
			{oneLine`The title track, CRIOLA, is a certified banger with a percussion line that
			sinks its teeth into your spinal cord and stays with you. It's the type of
			track you want to put on at a party just to watch it work itself into other people.`}
			<br/><br/>
			{oneLine`The compilation was put together two years ago by Music From Memory - a
			label that consistently unearths forgotten gems from around the world.
			If you haven't, I recommend diving into their other releases - Gigi
			Masin's Talk to the Sea is a great one that I would have shared out
			if I didn't already own it. CRIOLA is particularly special and perfectly
			suited for balmy summer listening. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.`}

		Issue 1 for June 2019--my issue--is a wonderful little album called Memories
		in Beach House, by a group called Seaside Lovers. Of all the albums I have
		listened to over the past 3 years, I have probably played this one the most--it's
		at least in the top 5. It's incredible. I first discovered this album on
		YouTube, presumably because I had been listening to another album from the
		CBS/Sony Sound Image series (read more about it in the link below), Haruomi
		Hosono's Pacific (also incredible--not hyperbole). It's not necessarily a
		June album, but it's definitely a warm weather album. I've chosen this album
		for my first issue primarily out of necessity. Light in the Attic Records
		reissued 1,000 copies of this album a couple months ago (I ordered it in
		January) for $45 a pop--original pressings go for $300+ on Discogs--and I
		knew I wanted to share it with both of you, so I bought myself 3 copies,
		and here we are now. As far as highlights are concerned, I'd say it's just
		a really great album with great flow and sequencing, and culminates/concludes
		with a real stunner and tearjerker masterpiece in "Blue Memories". It's way
		more nuanced and emotional than most exotica/tropicalia records, and I think
		that's what gives it so much charm. `}
