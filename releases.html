I imagine it sounds like what would have happened if Richard D James was spending more time naked in Icelandic hot springs and less time dropping acid in British clubs. The album then hums through Smell Memory and into the wonderfully textured There Is a Number of Small Things, building to a beautiful vocal crescendo. The B-side is my personal favorite. Never have two songs been more appropriately titled than Asleep on a Train and Awake on a Train. The back half of the album finds a wonderful groove with my highlights being Random Summer and The Ballad of the Broken String.<br/><br/>It’s very easy to draw comparisons to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Kid A era Radiohead and the like, all of whom were working in melodic soundscapes around the time this album came out. There’s a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy, however, that makes Yesterday Was Dramatic much more than an IDM also-ran of the era. Remember when twee wasn’t a pejorative?</div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"dataManager":"[]","props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/releases","query":{},"buildId":"x1GOX89vuxZCkSWPkVo5k","dynamicBuildId":false,"nextExport":true}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/releases" src="/_next/static/x1GOX89vuxZCkSWPkVo5k/pages/releases.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/x1GOX89vuxZCkSWPkVo5k/pages/_app.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-3df6523e264ff2ac6548.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.ab05a3736e2e941f048c.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-20277e11e65341c1b2af.js" async=""></script></body></html>
